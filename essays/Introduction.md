Iâ€™m Melanie Yang and initially I could never imagine myself majoring in MIS among all the business majors that we are offered. However, I always knew that technology is becoming more and more prominent in the future and in business, so I thought making myself familiar with this field would become a great asset.  
I am absolutely fascinated by the fact that through our own hands we are able to build something, out of nothing, something that is not even tangible, out of grasp yet could become essential to our everyday lives.
