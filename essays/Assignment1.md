My programming skills have greatly improved.
  I think definitely compared to the beginning of the course I have learned so much about coding, of course because I didn't know anything from before. It's fascinating how much work needs to be put into such simple commands,and aspects that I never expected before.Compared to not having any skills before, I think so far I have learned a lot from this course.
I am enthusiastic about programming.
  A lot of the times, programming becomes very frustrating because of all the small details that we have to be careful about, and even then sometimes things still don't work. But also that is why when something I worked very hard for starts working, it makes me really happy that it gives me a sense of accomplishment. 
I can do the WODs without looking at the screencast solutions.
  I'm not so sure about this because I think I tend to forget some things that we don't usually use anymore. However most of the things we learned form the wods we are still using it for recent assignments so even if i have to look at the screencasts it would be to make sure I do things right or smaller details. 
The labs have helped me to learn and I am able to complete them with confidence.
  Labs help out a lot and it really helps that we go thorugh it together during class. Sometimes maybe it's the way instructins are written, they're a little bit hard to understand so it helps that I can follow along in class. It helps me understand it better. 
I feel ready to move to the next stage of complexity in programming (building small web applications).
  I'm not sure if I am ready yet as I know I still get confused sometimes. Even with assignment 1 I had trouble with connecting the invoice to the main page through the server so I would like to get more familiar and practice first before moving on to the next stage. 
I think the class can be improved to help my learning.
  I think there's always room for improvement. Since the later half of this semester is online, I think it would be a good idea if maybe one every 2 weeks we had a time designated to get help, instead of us individually emailing the professor. We did something similar for assignment 1 and it greatly helped me and I think it helped a lot of the other students who had trouble with it on their own. 
There are things that work really well my learning in this class.
  I'm not sure if this class would be one of those that work well for me, because it is very challenging, but I think it is also very interesting how I am able to learn something completely new that I had no knowledge about before. It is all very new so I would like to learn more and truly see if this is something for me or not.
